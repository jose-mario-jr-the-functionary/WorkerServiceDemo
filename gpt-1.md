### üîç **Key Areas to Focus On**

These align with what ‚Äúback-end processing‚Äù and ‚Äúservice environments‚Äù typically mean in a .NET world:

#### 1. **C# Fundamentals (if rusty)**

- Data types, control flow (if/else, switch, loops)
- Classes, interfaces, inheritance
- LINQ (super common for querying data)
- Async/await (you _will_ run into this)

#### 2. **.NET Runtime Basics**

- Understand the structure of a .NET application (projects, dependencies, configuration)
- NuGet package manager
- The difference between .NET Framework and .NET (Core/5/6/7+). Your project is probably on .NET 6 or later.

#### 3. **Services in .NET**

This is where you‚Äôll want to spend extra time:

- **Windows Services** or **Worker Services** (`IHostedService`, `BackgroundService`)
  - These are typical for "background processing"
  - Look into the **Generic Host** model in .NET
- **Dependency Injection** (built into .NET Core and up)
- **Configuration and Logging**
  - Appsettings.json, ILogger<T>, etc.

#### 4. **Data Processing & Access**

- Entity Framework Core (if they use a database)
- ADO.NET (still used in performance-heavy cases)
- File handling / parsing (for jobs that process files or reports)
- Message Queues (check if they use something like RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, etc.)

#### 5. **Unit Testing / Integration Testing**

- xUnit or NUnit
- Mocking libraries (Moq is common)
- How to test background services or long-running processes

### üß† Pro Tips While Studying

- Set up a simple **worker service** project: `dotnet new worker`
- Get comfortable with **logging** ‚Äî logs are your best friend in background jobs.
- Practice **writing a service** that reads a file or hits an API every few seconds.
- If you can, ask your team what **message queue or scheduler** they‚Äôre using ‚Äî that‚Äôll help you tailor your prep.

Would you like me to help you spin up a simple example project? Like, a background service that processes a job queue or parses a file on a timer?
