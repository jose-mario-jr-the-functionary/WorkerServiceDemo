### üîß **Core Topics to Focus On**

These are the essentials for service-oriented back-end work in C#/.NET:

#### 1. **C# Fundamentals (if rusty)**

- Value vs reference types
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Async/await and Task-based programming
- LINQ (you‚Äôll use this _a lot_)
- Exception handling

#### 2. **.NET & Backend Service Architecture**

- ASP.NET Core (especially Web API)
- Dependency Injection (built-in in .NET Core)
- Configuration & appsettings.json
- Logging (Microsoft.Extensions.Logging or Serilog)

#### 3. **Background Services / Worker Services**

Since they mentioned ‚Äúback-end processing‚Äù, look into:

- [`IHostedService`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.ihostedservice)
- [`BackgroundService`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.backgroundservice)

This is the backbone of headless/background processing apps in .NET.

#### 4. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**

- For DB access. Learn about:
  - DbContext
  - Migrations
  - LINQ queries
  - Connection strings from config

#### 5. **Queueing & Messaging (Optional but useful)**

If your back-end involves message processing:

- Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, or Kafka
- `Channel<T>` or `BlockingCollection<T>` for in-memory producer-consumer patterns

#### 6. **Testing & Debugging**

- Unit testing with xUnit or NUnit
- Mocking with Moq
- Debugging background services in Visual Studio or VS Code

### üõ† Practice Project Ideas

To get hands-on quickly, try building a small service app like:

- A background job that pulls data from an API every X minutes and saves to a database.
- A queue processor that reads messages and performs some logic.
